# this utility uses Scraper api -- https://www.scraperapi.com/. Launch with version.txt in folder
### When you register, you will be given 5,000 free requests, and there is no rate limit for you.


### How it works?
The program sends a request to the discord api with a random invite link, and the discord api returns either a 404 status code (not found) or a status code 200 (OK)
But there is a problem that cloudflare blocks invalid requests if there are many of them, and your IP may be banned for the whole day. But Scraper api uses a proxy server and you do not use your IP to make the request, and the program can thus work even in five threads



### Tutorial
You need to insert a link to your webhook into the hook variable so that the script can send a working invite. You need to insert your key into the scraper API, you will find it on the site when you register, itâ€™s free, if you need more requests, you can buy more requests
Enjoy

Here you can change the number of characters in the invite; if you want to find unknown, private servers, then simply put the number 8.
Like for i in range(8):
